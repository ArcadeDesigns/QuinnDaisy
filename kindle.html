        How Kindle Direct Publishing Works
      </h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Book publications used to be a thing of great expense, limited to the pages of printed words on hand cover and papers, codified together and sold either in book shops around the area, or become a part of a countries school curriculum for national examinations and applications for exquisite literary events are the only assurance of getting global recognition and global sales. However the World seems to have changed this obsolete tradition and have introduced cross border and cross continent sales of books with little or no international headaches and efforts. Making Money from books sales and getting a greater level of audience just got easier. The World Wide Web is a space filled with infinite possibilities of greatness and measured through hard work and the level of expertise inputted into this process. You would agree with me that the internet has been blessed with so much knowledge, every part of it feels like a section lasting till infinity, and when it come to the generation of wealth in this twenty first (21st) century, the internet does indeed stake its claim as the number one leading hub in this reality. If you are from Asia or the middle east or Africa or Australia, any continent or country of the world, to get long range access and make friends in the most unlikely places, all you need is the World Wide Web and a social media platform; also coupled with this reality is the ability to sell products and services as well as run businesses online without having to be present physically. The World as seen the investment into Crypto-Currencies, the establishment of online store and Digital Currencies as well, all this are valid means of transactionery payment for service rendered across borders and continents avoiding the bureaucracy and problem of foreign exchange rates and difference in currency.

       However interesting this topic may seem, there is something much better, and it has an acronym; KDP. KDP which stands for Kindle Direct Publishing is Amazon’s gift to the world. The popular story of Amazon starting up from an apartment quite small to becoming the largest online book store in the world is quite inspirational. Adding to its ranks is the ability for authors and writers to publish exquisite contents online and get paid for its purchase. Amazon Kindle, is the aspect of Amazon that is created for writers and authors all over the world for the purchase of creating an enabling environment where their get to publish their works, and get paid anytime a purchase is made on the store, basically, Authors get paid in Royalties. Imagine this, you are an author from Nigeria and you hope to Publish heartfelt written contents about African Culture and the ills of bad governance; moving further, already I presume you’d have your contents set and ready, all you need to do is open an Amazon Kindle Account, register and fill in all the necessary forms and blanks, proceed to publications, create a cover image and you can get your book published either as an Ebook, or Paperback or Hardcover simples. If these books are published in Ebook formats, then they are made available online to be purchased by Amazon subscribers or readers who can either choose to read it from the comfort of their devices or Amazon Reading Tablet. If these books are purchased in Paperback or Hard Cover formats, they can be shipped to the buyers address irrespective of distances or importation duties, these characteristics makes Amazon a state of the art Publication hub for its Authors and an online Library resource for its users. Also imagine being able to sell books to individuals of other nationals and earn from it, but even more spread proud ideologies or interesting reads and make known extremely good writing skills. Of course to get to this point a price must have been set with other important features; let’s scrutinize some important things to note when using Amazon Kindle.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Amazon Kindle and the Process of Publication</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        The processes involve in the publication of books by Authors on Amazon Kindle are not quite difficult to understand, the very first thing is the presence of a manuscript written and save in docx format, however this does not negate files save an doc or PDF formats, but would be preferable if saved as doc or docx to allow for easy editing and correction of mistakes, as well as set the right margin and word alignment. The next step is to register an account, make all the necessary verification and add the account details and tax payment details as well. After completion of the verification process, then prospective authors and writer can proceed to login and head to the book shelf section of the account created where they’ll find everything required in the process of publishing books on Amazon Kindle. Also let me state that there are various login options on Amazon as a whole, you can create a login for Amazon online store, or for Amazon Kindle or even Amazon affiliate marketing, either way it is important to know which is intended to be used and in the post, we opt for Kindle.

        After creating a Kindle account and surfing to the book shelf section of Amazon Kindle page, the rest are self explanatory until it gets to the cover paper or the design for the book cover. At this point a computer system should suffice to do the rest. Amazon Kindle as on its cover photo section some certain template which could be used in the design of the Cover of your book however it s best advised to make use of self designed cover photos for the book, and to get the full gist on this part, a computer system should be used; mainly to get access to the full widgets and tools needed to create an attractive cover back or photo of the book to be published. With all this established, you’d move to the next section which would require you to set a price for the book to be sold, and you can as well make use of a standard price to be sold across borders in various countries like Japan, Canada, the United States, and even the EU, getting this done is the final step in the process of publication and after submission, a review is done to ascertain the book supports Amazon Kindle policies and is Plagiarism free.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Amazon Kindle Prospect of Generating Financial Income</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        After publication of a book on the kindle platform, with its price set, imagine having a book sales of ten copies for $20 or $45, and a royalty of $15 for each sales, that is an income of $150 from sales, then imagine bigger sales of  ten thousand copies or more (10,000) quite a great prospect if you ask me, what is even more is the ability to make sales across borders and spread cultural and socio-political ideologies still across border. Also you might want to take note; when setting the price of your book on Amazon Kindle; the payout price is the Royalty set during the process of the book publication and not the original price set, as that would cover the publication bill and custom duties if there is any. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Adding account details also takes a different process, as this would require setting up an international bank detail, which can be done if you are an author from Africa via the Payoneer platform; and like previous steps taken, registration, and verification of identity and generation of a checking account, and you all set and game.
