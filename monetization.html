        Monetization of Website post and Website Traffic
      </h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Commercialization of traffic on a website or webpage’s are an essential tool used by bloggers and website owners in a bid to earn from contents and posts on their website or webpage’s from the comfort of their homes or location with little or no work done for this action. With the growing establishment of online platforms, businesses and blogs where articles, information’s and services are posted for viewing, shared to an audience, or rendered to a customer, it is no doubt the use of agencies which post adverts for companies and organizations on affiliate or associate websites are growing. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Quite lucrative and capable to bringing in a large flow of income in just a day or two, for doing things like writing articles, sharing your views and opinions on topics flooding the internet, simply put, you get paid to write if writing is your passion, or you get paid to share gossip, and you can do this from the comfort of your home, all you need is to share a post or two on a website or web blog you own and you are very much on your way to start earning from this services. However the very first question and difficult part of setting up this means of income is getting a website.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">How to Get a Website or a Free Blog</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        There are various online applications and mobile Apps which can get this done with ease, all you need to get started is to register with this platform, and fill in the required details, and you have your websites with a domain name up and running, but before with get into that lets discuss the more professional way to get a website without having to pay a dime, totally free all it requires is a bit of your time and energy as well as the acquisition of relevant knowledge. Setting up a website without having to use Wordpress, Blogspot and the like could be a dream come true for some, you get to set up and design this site to your taste and break free from the limiting themes and template of these mobile or web Applications used for website development; to understand what this means all you need to know is the process involved in the building and setting up of a website. When it comes to building a website or web application, things like Html, Css and JavaScript comes to mind. This three are the trio needed in the construction of a professional site, you can either learn this are taking an online class from paid organization like; Udemy, Codemy or Giraffe Academy or get started with free readable materials and visual self taught practice online, by this I mean you can download and read books on the topic or watch free YouTube videos on this process. However this does not explain the required process needed in launching the website, but is the first and most important step before the next section comes in. After breaking the rules of paid lessons to understand the process of Website development, we move further to web hosting as this is a very expensive service offered by specialized companies online, companies like Hostinger, Bluehost, Go Daddy hosting services and many more, but there is also GitHub. I’m pretty sure if you took your time learning Html, Css and JavaScript within three week you know everything you need to know to develop a Website or a maximum of three month, within which you would have become an expert on the subject; definitely you would have come across GitHub and online platform for developer and other Tech geeks. Github serves as an online cloud platform for tech geeks to host their projects online and share it with other tech gurus like themselves, but GitHub could also double as a hosting platform with its own domain name given. To get this done, compile all you website Development files into a single folder but be sure to leave the index.html and other html files out of it as this could make locating your Index.html file and the GitHub domain name difficult. Upon uploading these files to your created GitHub repository, you should get you repository name and under it, your Index.html files and other html files with the folder, which would be professionally named Assets. After this you move to the GitHub setting and click on the Page option then active the GitHub page environment, and get a GitHub domain name which would be linked to your Index.html file, the domain name should look a little like: “repository name.github.io”. After doing this successfully you’ll have a domain name and a free hosting site and a ready website the next step would require a bit of payment, “Purchasing a Domain” this is the final and most important step in setting up a free website and running it. You could get a year’s domain for as low as $2 from Go Daddy and that is pretty generous as most domain sells for $9 above. Once this is done connect the domain to you GitHub repository and you all set. However if this steps seems to be cumbersome or hard to go through, you could easily hiring a Web Developer to help you build a website and set it up, however this services are quite expensive as a Web Developer could charge are much as $1500 to build a website. You can also get a free website from Wordpress.com, free hosting and free domain name given with the extension of a WordPress name, however, this domain Names are not accepted by most Ads agencies and would require you to purchase the site which is also quite expensive. You can use BlogSpot as well to set up a web blog as Google Adsense support the use of Blog Spot but may require you to purchase and get a custom domain as well, or you could get a website build for you and set up for as low as $150 by clicking on the link <a href =“arcadedesigns.github.io/Avalanche”>Avalanche Website Development Agency. </a> either way to set up your income from Web Traffic and the likes you’ll need to have a website and publish contents constantly.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Monetization of Web Contents and Website Traffic</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        At this point a website with a purchased domain should be up and running, then the next step is to post contents which are 100% self written or developed with no plagiarism or copied work. Once this is ascertained then focus should be directed to the privacy policies, disclaimer policies and the California Advertising Policies (California Consumer Privacy Act) and European Union User Consent Policy for those seeking to publish ads from Google Adsense on their site. Most Ads agencies would give the permission to publish contents on a website for free without scrutinizing these policies but would also reap off the website owners with very little pay on Traffic and clicks on Ads. To get the best possible outcome, I would advise every privacy policies are met and well catered for. Upon successful notification of users and viewer of this policies then you are go to go for registration to show ads on your website.
      </p>
      
      <p class="post-text">
          Here are some ads agencies you could apply with
          <ul class="post-text">
              <li>Google adsense</li>
              <li>Propeller ads</li>
              <li>Adsterra</li>
              <li>Amazon affiliate. Etc.</li>
            </ul>
            However the best from personal opinion is Google Adsesne, it offers great pays and professional display of ads on your site.
