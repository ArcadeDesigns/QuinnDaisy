          What does the word “Heart Break” mean? If you’d ask the myriads of
          Youths, Lovers, Teenagers, boys and girls roaming the streets, various
          answers would be given, some might even say it’s a transaction, but
          take a little child by the road side for example, a child of ten or
          eleven years old watching his father walking out on him/her and their
          mother, maybe a soldier, or a cheating husband, or a divorced parent,
          only

          The reality behind Love is cute and quite exhausting at the same time.
          What comes with Love is the complexity of acknowledging the
          vulnerability that this brings. Unfortunately we don’t choose who we
          fall in Love with and what’s more is the secret that could come along
          with it. This book is a very great read; the Reminders of Him by
          Colleen Hoover is wrapped in a complex plot and setting intended to
          bring out the best with the use of suspense and a tragic flow.

          Web blogging seems to be a lucrative business flooding the internet
          with various blog site created with content monetization being the
          major aim. However this process could sometimes be tricky as most
          individuals are known to be money oriented at the detriment of
          original and professional content and information to be passed.
