      <h2 class="sub-heading">What You Need To Know About Heart Breaks</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        What does the word “Heart Break” mean? If you’d ask the myriads of
        Youths, Lovers, Teenagers, boys and girls roaming the streets, various
        answers would be given, some might even say it’s a transaction, but take
        a little child by the road side for example, a child of ten or eleven
        years old watching his father walking out on him/her and their mother,
        maybe a soldier, or a cheating husband, or a divorced parent, only to
        end up being killed at war, or creating a broken home, however you
        describe this events, one thing is sure, Heart Break. The distractive
        pain of quakes in the heart, and the continuous regret, however long
        they last, or as much as it needs to last, a time to be fulfilled. The
        sad truth is there is nothing any humans can do to flip the switch and
        stop the painful emotions as every bit of emotions and passion would be
        felt and expressed in its little bit right down to the point where every
        hate and pain, and hurt is exhausted, just then a brief moment of relief
        and then the pain of the reality of what is lost comes rushing back in.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        It has been scientifically proven that the heart plays a part in human
        emotions particularly love and heart break, funny though as it is the
        brain which translate what is felt, yet the heart feels it and respond
        to this actions. However not magic of some sort or an organic function
        of the heart, this feeling is caused by a chemical compound secreted in
        the heart and upon trigger by the brain the emotions come rushing in and
        so does the sensational feeling of the heart drawing near in love and
        the sensational feeling of the heart being squeezed in pain. Both
        feelings and emotions are felt by the Heart, but our focus is the pain.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Ever wondered why it could take years to get over a loved one, a lover
        or someone we cared about who was lost either to a tragic accident or to
        a lover’s quarrel or to the simple term of fate, every factors mentioned
        are still controlled and guaranteed by one major factor “Personality”.
        Personality dictates a lot in any relationship. Even with this a large
        group of individuals would debate that fate is the major factor.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Fate plays a significant part in what should or should not be, as most
        people or individual believe fate simply dictate what is meant to be and
        what is not meant to be, sadly, this claim may or may not be true as
        personality plays a larger part in the success of a relationship.
        Imagine it this way, an alpha male and alpha female in a relationship
        with one another would definitely lead to a break up except one alpha is
        willing to bow, or a country side girl who believes in culture and state
        traditions and a city adventurer who as lost every bit of culture and
        lives the life of a party, would lead to a personality clash originating
        from ideological differences which would doom the relationship, only in
        rear cases do you see such relationships working out, but then things
        that deals with love and life are quite complicated with no
        instructional Manuel to guide our steps and rules to play by varies from
        individual experience, therefore mistakes are guaranteed and so is love,
        lust, heartbreak and hurt.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        In a way the expectation of hurt governs the relationship, serving as a
        prelude to paranoia and fear. Loving with the whole heart is guaranteed
        to lead to heartbreak at one point or the other, sadly a heart in Love
        would stick around till all hope is lost and then break up, either way
        Heart Break. According to statistics measuring the percentage of the
        world population who has been hurt by trusting or believing in the wrong
        notion, a 95% rate and the pain from Love is guaranteed 100% bring up
        the question, “How to avoid being Heart Broken?”.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Running from Heart Broken</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        The simple trick would be not to Love again and live free from the
        commitments and expectations, fortunately this is not so, maybe for a
        couple of years to abstain from romantic relationships, however there is
        friendship and family, those things are riddled with Love and where
        there is Love there is expectation, and there is commitment. Ultimately,
        Love and Heart Break are two part of Human Interaction on earth and
        having to live without them is like having to live without breathing.
        These things make and break a man; it all depends on the way it is
        handled. For one a certain level of maturity and determination is
        required, confidence and self reliance are also admirable traits.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Distractions could seem like viable source for quick recovery, being
        engrossed in work or a certain duty, this only prolong the time it would
        take to heal, and when the distraction and façade are gone, then the
        pain returns, a complex human system which cannot be cheated or tricked.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        In the end the question of Heart Break and Love would forever be a
        pressing issue and how it is dealt with would be reflected based on the
        level of maturity, commitment, and personality of individual parties.
