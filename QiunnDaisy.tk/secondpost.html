        What You Should Know About Web Design and Development
      </h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        I have come in contact with various individuals who ignorantly use the
        words “Web Design” and “Web Development” interchangeably, however this
        words are related to two different aspects of website operations as
        would be explained in this article
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Web development is a major part of the internet network platform with
        terms like web design and web blogging often misused in its place.
        Various websites on the internet are usually developed after being
        designed using plain graphics applications or sophisticated graphics
        design platforms. The process of designing a websites using graphical
        representation is known as web design, to simply put, web development is
        the process building of website which has already been designed
        graphically. Web blogging on the other hand is the process of operating
        a specified website used for blog post and sharing of articles and
        information’s. Various web blogs and websites can be gotten from online
        platforms like blogspot.com, wordpress.com and many more, but this
        should not be mistaken for the process of web development as this
        process requires some level of computer literacy in the aspect of
        Hypertext Makeup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) as well
        as JavaScript (JS), to simply put, some level of understanding of makeup
        and programming languages.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        HTML which is the most prominent part of Web Development is most times
        regarded as the skeleton of any website to be built. It serves as the
        frame work of what should or is intended to be built; containing
        everything needed in the site. The HTML often contains five major parts
        or sections with the first being the head-section which contains the
        website title and Meta tags. The Meta tags play a very vital role in SEO
        (Search Engine Optimization) which is used to give its users a great
        experience while surfing around the Website and enables the site to be
        easily found on the World Wide Web when topics and articles related to
        it are searched for. The head-section of the Website is also used to
        link various important documents and files like the style sheet and
        other binding documents (JavaScript or Bootstrap) which are essential to
        the styling and function of the website.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        There is also the body which contains other major parts of the websites
        like the main, article, sections and divisions as well as the aside. The
        main section contains the web post or blog post which are usually found
        under the article section, while the part designated sections could
        sometimes contain images and links in the site with the aside mostly
        used for advert placement and other non important post on the site. Also
        note that it is important to arrange Website in a specified order to
        increase its Search Engine Optimization, as proper arrangement would
        help Google search engine to quickly and easily navigate through the
        site and determine what it is all about. There is also the footer
        section which contains copyright details of the site, quick links and
        other informative and useful details about the site. All this make up
        the HTML part of any website being developed. Although these are not
        enough to development a full profession website or web blog as the CSS
        is very important in the beautification process of the website.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The CSS is used solely for the purpose of addressing the user interface
        of the website, in other words making the website or blog presentable to
        the eyes. This file contains all the necessary codes that affect the
        colour, font, width, height, background and many more. Without the CSS
        the web site or blog would look plain and inartistic.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The JavaScript controls the functionality of the website. Remember the
        HTML is the framework of what is intended to be designed, the CSS is the
        beautification of what has been designed while the use of JavaScript
        takes care of the functionality of the website, functions like
        slideshow, menu toggles, form sign in and registration and many more.
        Although various websites can be designed using just HTML and CSS the
        use of JavaScript gives it a sense of professionalism and functionality.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Web Development and Web Blogging</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Unknown to many individuals, Web development could be a useful tool in
        the act of web blogging. Compared to web blogs gotten from various blogs
        built using extensions and other web applications, the knowledge of web
        development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript could help a web blogger
        build a suitable web blog, one that would meet their personal taste and
        purpose of blogging. Beyond personal preference, knowledge of web
        development using the languages could look good on ones curriculum vitae
        (C.V) when applying for employment and could invariable give the
        individual an edge over the others. Basically the basic knowledge of web
        development possesses various pros and very limited cons especially
        relating to the aspect of professionalism and independence as a web blog
        and website developer.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Career Opportunity</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Web development could seems like a long way to go in the process of
        starting up a career in programming and software development, however
        this is not true, as the basic of any programming career could almost
        always starts with the use of Html and Css first. This are the basic
        part of programming which teaches and give a sense of understanding of
        basic algorithm, programming structure and bugging or debugging. With
        the use of Html and Css any novice or beginner could become a simple web
        developer although lacking the functionality and expertise of a
        professional, it’s a very good place to start and the best part is, it
        can be self taught with the use of various books and online videos
        address this topic, not to mention myriads of platforms which respond to
        tech questions concerning the basics of Html and Css. After gaining some
        level of expertise in Html and Css, with basic knowledge of JavaScript,
        a career is set and good to go. However it is very advisable to build
        websites and host them on free hosting platforms to serve as a sample of
        work done which would most times be used by employers to dash out gigs.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        In the aspect of income, programmers and software developers also rake
        in high income and are given the choice of self employment or working
        from home, all you need is a computer system active network service and
        probably a cell phone.
