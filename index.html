        <p class="post-description">
          The reality behind Love is cute and quite exhausting at the same time.
          What comes with Love is the complexity of acknowledging the
          vulnerability that this brings. Unfortunately we don’t choose who we
          fall in Love with and what’s more is the secret that could come along
          with it. This book is a very great read; the Reminders of Him by
          Colleen Hoover is wrapped in a complex plot and setting intended to
          bring out the best with the use of suspense and a tragic flow.
