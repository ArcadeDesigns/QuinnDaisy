        What You Need to Know About Programming Languages (Website Development
        and Software Programming)
      </h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Programming languages are used vastly in the computer and technological
        verse, a prominent term used among computer literate and other
        technological enthusiast. Various Programming languages have flooded the
        World with different level of complexities, and with these complexities,
        various usages. Take for example; the use of a simple HTML and CSS
        languages which are considered to be mark up languages, also known as
        the front end development, this languages are powerful tools in the
        hands of an expert programmer, however limited in its operations and the
        process of building Android Applications, and other aspects of
        programming.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Moving further there is also the backend development languages which
        comprises of PYTHON Programming Language, JAVA, JAVASCRIPT, RUBY, RUST,
        PHP and many more, this undoubtedly brings to mind the complexities and
        advance status of this languages which would dictate how they are used
        and how proficient its outcome would be upon utilization. All in all,
        Programming Languages are an important part of human evolution bringing
        to mind, the phrase
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">“The world is fast becoming a global village!”</p>
      <p class="post-text">
        This is a phase that has been resounded from generation to generation
        with its clamor not going unheeded to as the world as seen the rise of
        programmers like never before skilled and well equipped with knowledge
        of various programming languages.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        In this post, we’ll discuss the front end and Back end programming
        Languages and could move further to discuss the setting up of Database
        which are a major aspect on the advance and more complex part of
        programming. Let’s begin with the front end language of programming:
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Website Development</h2>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Front end development</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        This is used in the process of website development and consists of three
        major languages, HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. These three languages are
        used for the front end development of websites and are crucial in their
        roles.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language):</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Take this to be the skeletal structure of a human body, which is carved
        in all the right places and carries the framework of the body. The HTML
        is used to setup the framework of a website. It sets up the structure
        and how the website would look like upon beautification and
        functionality. From the header to the body to the footer section, the
        HTML carries this code which is used to dictate how the site flows at
        different sections.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">CSS (Cascading Style Sheet):</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        The CSS is also an important part in the process of website development,
        this is used to beautiful the website and give the images in it some
        level of complexity, the CSS can be liken to the human skin, which gives
        beautification and covers all the human organs of functionality. Without
        the CSS most websites would look heinous and unattractive.
      </p>

      <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-7590529377787290"
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
      <ins class="adsbygoogle"
        style="display:block; text-align:center;"
        data-ad-layout="in-article"
        data-ad-format="fluid"
        data-ad-client="ca-pub-7590529377787290"
        data-ad-slot="8534781747"></ins>
      <script>
        (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
      </script>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">JS (JAVASCRIPT):</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        This language is used to give the website greater level of functionality
        like form activation and validation, slide shows, status bar, menu drop
        down functions and many more, without the use of JavaScript then the
        website would be just another static page with no major function.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        In summary this three languages make up the front end languages in the
        process of website development and are used mainly in the process of
        developing a website. However the CSS is also used in PYTHON programming
        language which is a backend programming language. The use of CSS in
        PYTHON programming is mainly to give the application beautification like
        the hover effects, background color and text alignment, font style and
        font size. The use of CSS is seen in the use of PyQt5 aspect of PYTHON
        programming.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Still on the front end, the use of React.JS a library of JavaScript for
        web application is very much a big thing in the industry as most
        companies and organization would prefer the use of a web application
        over a static or dynamic website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        alone. Web application offers greater functionality and effective
        service delivery for various companies and organization websites or in
        this case web applications.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The front end languages offers some level of beginners algorithm and can
        be understood with ease especially for newbie’s on course in the journey
        to become a junior programmer, or a senior and full stack programmer,
        either way, if developing a passion for programming or desiring to start
        up a career in this filed and don’t know where to start, HTML should be
        the first on your list, afterwards, CSS then JAVASCRIPT.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Software Programming</h2>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Back End Programming Languages</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Back end Programming Languages are a different part of programming,
        consisting of the more complex and difficult part of its field. Let’s
        say a student is newly admitted into an institution and offers the
        beginners course, all too simple and an introduction to future courses
        of the Student choice of study and stay at the institution, this course
        would consist of HTML, CSS, and low level JAVASCRIPT as beginner’s
        course which all together makes up the Front End Development. Upon
        extension and a move to the upper class, the student would have to drop
        the Elective Course and declare a Major, the elective courses in the
        case are the React.JS, Vue.JS, Angular.JS and many more, still all part
        of JavaScript but on a simpler scale. Now depending on the student’s
        choice of career either to become a software programmer (Python, Java,
        etc.) or Andriod Programmer (Kotlin, Java, Kivy, etc.) the student would
        have to choose the language that best suit their career choice. In other
        words it is very advisable for you to learn and master HTML, CSS and
        JAVASCRIPT before advancing to the big leagues as this would help in
        easy comprehension and understanding of the frame work of the
        Programming Language.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Moving further, I would like to be the first to issue this subtle
        warning
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        “The world would require a certain level of technological knowledge to
        advance in the next step of human evolution”.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Human evolution as been untamed and has been advancing so rapidly with
        an explosive rate in the area technological advancement which cannot be
        ignored. Hundred years back, the world would doubt the existence of a
        deep space satellite capable of seeing the farthest part of the Milky
        Way and talks about interstellar space travels would be a thing of
        science fiction, but in the present all these are reality. The launch of
        the James Hobbs Satellite and the creation of space craft half as fast
        as the speed of light, the fastest speed of travel is all thanks to
        technological advancement.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Learning certain Programming Languages is no longer an option but a
        mandate. Take a look at the world of Software Programming. The invention
        of new and complex robotics capable of replacing humans at place of
        works and other fronts, equipped with artificial intelligence and the
        right attitude, never getting tired or disobeying orders, one hundred
        percent loyal as long as it is programmed right and built to serve its
        functions, this could replace humans and could help employers safe more
        from salaries and minimum wages in place of maintenance cost. However
        the maintenance cost would require a developer or programming coming in
        to do just that, and get paid, making the field lucrative as it gets.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Back end languages like PYTHON which are used in Software development is
        also a very good language choice. Like JavaScript, Python consist of
        other Libraries as well like the PyQt5, KivyMD, TKinter, SimpleGui and
        many more. All this libraries compensate the programming language in the
        process of software development, PyQt5 contains a frame work of designs
        used to start up the software design and employ the use of CSS to
        beautify it, while KivyMD is a library used for Android and Mobile
        Application Development, TKinter also like PyQt5 is used for developing
        software’s however an obsolete library of Python Programming Language.
        There is also the Socket library used to create interaction Applications
        like Chat bot, Social Media platforms, etc. all this libraries are a
        part of the Python Programming Language and are easy to learn and
        master. Where to start from would be simple “INPUT” and “PRINT”
        statements before advancing to the big leagues.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Also part of the Back End Language is “Java”; used in Android
        Application development however is being replaced by Kotlin which are
        invented in 2011, the two programming languages are very similar and
        very prominent in the process of Android Application Development, all
        you need to start writing programmes in this language is to download its
        IDE, (Integrated Development Environment) INTELLI-J on your computer
        system and learn the basics before proceeding to the first project app
        creation and within three to six month professional knowledge of Android
        App Development is acquired.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        All these Applications would surely need a Database to operate on as it
        would guarantee the use of Users information’s for sign up, Log in, and
        Interactive purposes, all leading to the use of Firebase Authentication,
        PHPmyAdmin, or even Sqlite3, there is also MongoDB, all part of a
        complex Database management system. Database is an important part of
        Software or Application development for various platforms, and cannot be
        overemphasized, so be it a web application, or software development,
        in-depth knowledge of Database creation, management, and analysis are
        important for any programmer. Also to note, a programmer with knowledge
        in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and any Backend Language with Database is a
        Full Stack Developer and very expensive to afford. In most cases
        knowledge of database comes with the knowledge of PHP programming
        Language.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        In summary you should also note that becoming a programmer is not a
        child’s play, either is it a day’s job, as programmers spend years of
        their lives trying to development the best and most profitable
        application with the intention to either sell it off or commercialize
        its usage, either way, if you playing to start up a career in
        programming, always remember this rule, “As a programmer you have to
        solve technological problems and make life easier”.
