      </h2>
      <p class="post-text">

        from the structure of the website to the proper use of headers and other
        compulsory elements of a well designed website. When it comes to the
        elements involved in ensuring Search Engine Optimization, the principles
        of Meta Tags comes to mind for website developers and for bloggers the
        principles of social media influencing and promotions. There are also
        website capable of generating huge organic traffic, of course for a
        certain price, however this is not advisable as this would in time
        weaken the website projective force and the future to ascertain real
        influence by engaging with targeted audience, this process does not also
        guarantee any real dissemination of information prospect or search hits
        on Google Search Engine; then finally there are paid adverts on post for
        social media’s like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram capable of
        generating huge traffic as well, also the use of hash tags and tagging
        user-addresses of prominent individuals or organizations and trending
        topics could come in handy, however traffic is sort after online, or on
        various social media platforms, proper understanding on the operations
        of Search Engine Optimization and how it works as an whole made up of
        complex pieces which are very much needed and important in ensuring a
        fully functional Search Engine Optimization.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        The very first advise that would be given by any SEO expert would be
        drawing up a plan, a long tern plan to guarantee how SEO’s are managed
        in other to get a continuous flow of organic traffic; traffic generated
        enough to ensure prominence for new website, and big earnings for
        monetization of contents and affiliate marketing for websites into that
        field.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        If you are very familiar with SEO’s as a website developer, then
        certainly you would have come across a robot.txt and sitemap.xml
        documents, two very keen and very important aspect of Search Engine
        Optimization, of course this would involve Google Console which we would
        discuss on in this post, but before we get to that, let’s start with the
        known basic; The process needed to attain Search Engine Optimization:
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Structure of the Website:</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        An expert website designer would definitely put all this into account
        before giving off their design for development. The structure of the
        website, from the head which would include the title, and meta tags as
        well as other crucial component the website would need, to a body tag
        which would contain various sections like the header, main and footer
        sections, in the main section there might be a div or an aside or an
        article tag depending on how the website would be developed. The main
        tag, would be the main body of the website, the article tag would cover
        all written post while the aside might be used to identify a division in
        the main section for advert placement and other important aspect of the
        website which might be kept exclusively; also there is the image (img)
        division, which could serve as the gallery or service view. Putting into
        account this entire factor when designing and developing a website is
        very much necessary as it would help with scalability of the website and
        easy access for Google to acknowledge and ascertain what the website is
        about and what it entails.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Meta tags:</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        This is another developer tool, the Meta Tag contains six important
        part, namely the title and og:title, to the description, keywords, as
        well as the og:description and og:keyword. These Meta Tags are used to
        give the website page a title, a description and very keywords which
        would be called upon by the search engine when related subjects are
        searched upon.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Content of the Website:</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Contents on websites with their words below 300 are considered to be
        extremely low and has no real prospect in maintain aggressive traffic
        flow, much more are plagiarized contents which could involve a law suit.
        Website Contents are a major consideration by SEO experts, your website
        is only as good as your content, as this would determine if it would be
        visited on a regular basis or just another low quality content website.
        Either way you need your content to be of high quality and hold
        informative contents, hire a content writer if needed, the target should
        be to get on the great side of SEO.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Know Your Audience:</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Perhaps the most important aspect of SEO, you don’t expect to write or
        post contents concerning politics and engage audience who are interested
        in Books or research. Study your audience, ascertain their wants and
        needs, then conclusively write articles and post in line with what
        you’ve noted. Your audience would be loyal and on time as long as they
        get everything they need from you.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Privacy Policy:</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Beware of the privacy policy page, particularly if you offer services to
        those in the EU or under the California Privacy Policy quote (CCPA and
        GPRA privacy policies). This would be major tool to determine if you
        would be enrolled into Google Adsense program or other exclusive
        affiliate marketing services.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Understanding Sitemap.xml Documents</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        All said and done concerning SEO’s on the face value aspect; when it
        comes to sitemap.xml, it is a totally different aspect of SEO, which
        includes connecting this document to a website and Google Console. Ever
        wondered why search hits specific websites concerning a general subject
        you are surfing the internet for, however not related to what you want,
        but it still shows up on your search hit; this is because of Google
        Console and the sitemap.xml.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">What is a Sitemap.xml?</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        If you are conversant with basic programming, and a certain level of
        website development, then you would be no stranger to sitemap.xml. just
        like your index.html file is the default home page, your sitemap.xml is
        what you use to map out your website pages in order of importance to
        appear of Google Search engine in the hierarchy when searched for. The
        Sitemap.xml is written to give the search engines a description of the
        website and when crawling through it, it does this knowing which page is
        important, which comes first and which comes last.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">
        Understanding the Role of Sitemap and Google Console in Search Engine
        Optimization:
      </h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        As earlier explained, a sitemap.xml is like a guiding compass which
        tells and describes to search engines which website pages are first and
        which ones are last. Upon connection to Google Console, which makes use
        of this information scales the website and makes its pages available
        using the Meta Tags to ascertain for sure what they are all about and
        make them available in the search hit on their search engine, Google
        Search Engine in Particular.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Understanding that Search Engine Optimization goes beyond referrals and
        posting of links on various Social Media platforms to an in-depth
        understanding of how it works and what to expect from the implementation
        of one aspect, however advisable to ensure all aspect are put into good
        use to ensure Search Engine Optimization.
