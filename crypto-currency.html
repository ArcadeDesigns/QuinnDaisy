      <h2 class="sub-heading">The Crypto Verse</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        There is not a soul alive today that isn’t aware of the digital and
        crypto market with millions of investors and billions of dollars
        invested in this platform from its start a while back in 2009. The
        leading and first crypto currency, the Bitcoin has been a sensational
        talk on various social media. Various platforms as been designed to
        accommodate its operations and ensure all-round performance throughout
        the globe. The invention of other crypto assets came through as well
        following the success of this leading platform used in various payment
        structures and for various payment transactions. However the crypto
        world as also witness a large scale down trend in its flow following its
        reach of an all time high of $60,000 [sixty thousand dollars] and a
        subsequent fall to $32,000 [thirty two thousand dollars], it is still
        believed that with this fall, the Crypto world would recover and become
        better than ever before, reaching a predicted all time high of one
        hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Following recent trends and boom in the crypto world one could
        undoubtedly predict a flow in its investment and policy formation. It
        experienced a great boom from its previous price of $35,000[thirty five
        thousand dollars] to $42,000 [forty two thousand dollars] with future
        prediction of the price reaching an all time high of $100,000 [one
        hundred thousand dollars], this prediction is seeming to come true with
        the price of the Bitcoin souring to a whopping forty six thousand
        dollars ($46,000) and from analysis flow it could very much still sour
        high. With the latest updates coming from the crypto world it is however
        still very unlikely to predict if it is a good time to trade or hold,
        not to mention the bad times it had gone through in the past with a
        major crash in the past year. The leading crypto coin, the Bitcoin
        suffered a great crash with its investors suffering great loss, coupled
        with the ban on its operations in several countries of the international
        community; this has not deterred some individuals from investing in its
        platform and purchasing Crypto assets using proxy means and peer to peer
        transactions. With all this dark, ghostly transactions taking place
        behind the scene and against various bans accompanied by various
        acceptance as major payment methods, the Bitcoin is still very much
        powerful with the ability to make millionaires and billionaires of this
        present generation; however this process could be risky and lucrative if
        done the right way.

      <p class="post-text">
        With all this said and done, one major question comes to mind; how do
        one gain massive income and profits from the Crypto Verse?
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Holding Crypto Assets in Crypto Wallets</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Holding Crypto assets in crypto wallets can be very lucrative, imagine
        this, buying certain assets of crypto numbering 20 at a lower rates of
        five dollars ($5) which would cost an hundred dollars ($100) and within
        the next few days, few weeks or few months a boom and sudden increase to
        twenty dollars ($20) per asset, that’s a profit of three hundred dollars
        $300 and an investment well placed. However losses may occur if the
        price or worth of the assets reduces; for example, a reduction in price
        to about two dollars ($2) per assets or even a greater reduction.
        Therefore holding crypto assets can be lucrative if the right
        investments are made, or could go the direct opposite.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Trading Crypto Assets</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        You need to note that the principles of holding also affects Crypto
        trading except if your traded assets include USDT (United State Dollar
        Tether), as this have a fixed price ranging between five hundred and
        eighty six dollars ($586) to five hundred and ninety dollars ($590).
        Trading peers could sometimes lead to loss; as such peers traded for
        another could experience a sudden hike or drop in price; for example;
        “let’s say the traded peers were BTC (the Bitcoin) and BNB (Binance
        Coin), if the worth of 450 Binance coin could purchase 225 Bitcoin and a
        trade is made only to discover that there is an increase in the worth of
        the Binance Coin and 450 of its assets could now purchase 300 Bitcion,
        then the transaction which gave 225 Bitcoin led to a loss, as the worth
        of the Bitcoin won’t be enough to purchase 450 Binance assets and vice
        versa”; either way Crypto trading is still lucrative if done properly
        with the right knowledge on how to trade this assets.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Best Crypto Assets to Hold or Trade</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        There are a lot of crypto wallets to facilitate the purchase of crypto
        assets, holding, transfer or withdrawal of these assets, deciding on the
        best wallets would depend on certain principles with one major
        consideration being the choice of the individual. Also security
        considerations should be top on this list, as crypto assets are prone to
        cyber attacks which may lead to loss of assets. Also speed of
        transaction and guaranteed of flexibility in verification processes
        would go a long way in making a decision on the best Crypto wallets to
        choose for holding Crypto assets as such verification processes could be
        sometimes cumbersome and could take a lot of time to get done.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">The Risks of Investing Crypto Currency</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        The Forex market as a risk warning on the investments of capital which
        could be lost in the process of trading, this risk warning is not
        restricted to the Forex market alone, as the Crypto Verse is also part
        of this reality, at any point there could be a cyber attack, or a sudden
        dip in worth, or loss of pass code, or wallet key, or seizure of
        proceeds from the sales or transactionery profits of Crypto assets by
        the financial institutions. Crypto Investment is not without its risk,
        but the ability to manage such risk is what guarantees a successful
        trading or holding profitable operation in the Crypto Verse.
