        The policies guiding the acquisition of assets in the crypto verse and
        trading for profit in the Forex market are two different policies.
        Trading in the Forex market are well regulated and monitored by the
        global body of banking and industries across the world and follows
        strict banking policies which are reviewed on a regular basis and
        updated; while that of the crypto currency are regulated based on the
        investments in its assets, the more investors, the more money, and the
        prospect of a greater future, basically the crypto world is controlled
        by its investors with a white paper to guarantee its authenticity, two
        great prospects of generating massive income with ease, however of great
        risk potentials as all capital invested in them could be lost in a wrong
        trade input or asset acquisition.

      <p class="post-text">
        The world came into the evolution of digital currency due to the
        introduction of the Crypto Currency, a new prospect of mobile and online
        banking and transactions but without the banks or indigenous countries
        currency and required only the purchase and holding of crypto assets,
        with the ability to conduct businesses and make payment seamlessly.
        However the Crypto verse and its operations suffered greatly following
        global restrictions on its activities due to its unregulated nature in
        price and its strength to make or break wealth, highly volatile and
        could crash at any point due to its lack of sustenance and
        contingencies. The trading of Crypto currency, when first introduced
        seemed like a gold mine, paving the way for more ground breaking
        discovery in the banking sector; it came with the ability to transfer
        assets across borders with ease, bypassing the bureaucracy of most
        country banking sector, and its hectic banking procedures. Unique wallet
        ID’s were created, operated by a complex block chain network, which made
        it difficult to hack therefore, eradicating the issue of losing money to
        fraudulent activities. But with this advantage came the disadvantage of
        money Laundering using the complex Crypto Wallet ID, which made tracking
        of transactions and wallets holders’ identity difficult. Also the use of
        Crypto Currency made it difficult for the banking sector to monitor and
        report suspicious financial activities as it was impossible to monitor
        the transactions of its users; basically the introduction of the Crypto
        Currency came with the ease of doing businesses across borders, and the
        ease of running financial transactions and illegal activities which is
        unacceptable, thus the banning of its transactions in various countries.

        Moving further, when it comes to the trading of Crypto Currencies to
        maximize profit and Forex Trading to generate income, the two wonderful
        concepts with the ability to generate immense income, and at the same
        time lose the entire capital a for wrong trade or loss in market value.
        Monitoring the rise in fall of Crypto assets for Crypto traders is a
        part of their live using platforms like;
        <a href="https://www.Investopedia.com" class="back-home">
          Investopedia </a
        >or
        <a href="https://www.Coinbase.com" class="back-home"> Coinbase </a> and
        <a href="https://www.Coinmarketcap.com" class="back-home">
          Coinmarketcap </a
        >, particularly the
        <a href="https://www.Coinbase.com" class="back-home"> Coinbase </a>
        platform which guarantees an up to date analysis of the price movement
        marginalization and market capitalization with notification of any
        sudden rise or fall in assets worth. Also
        <a href="https://www.Binance.com" class="back-home"> Binance </a>,
        another Crypto platform which specializes in the analysis of the Crypto
        market, Launching and giving notifications of airdrops as well as
        providing a means of Crypto trading as been essential in upholding the
        existence of the Crypto verse, managing to regulate the activities of
        the Crypto Market and providing other Crypto Trading option beyond hold
        of assets to Peer to Peer trading, Future Crypto Trading, Spot trading
        and Marginal Trading, all part of the trading experience. However with
        all this trading options, the probability of incurring lose is still
        great, except if you focus solely on the spot trading which is still
        very risky, as this is a form of holding Crypto assets and waiting for
        its values to rise before selling, then purchase assets when it is low
        to make profit; during the process of holding an asset, there is no
        telling if it would crash in price and worth or if it would rise. This
        sole reason makes Crypto trading unreliable and unstable. Following news
        update and content release from
        <a href="https://www.Merriam-webstar.com" class="back-home">
          Merriam-webstar</a
        >
        and <a href="https://www.Ig.com" class="back-home"> Ig </a> which still
        stresses the volatile nature of Crypto assets, it is confirmed beyond
        reasonable doubt that the Crypto world might be lucrative, but the risk
        of lose are real as well.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Forex Market:</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        The Forex market has been characterized with complex fluctuation is the
        Global economy and in recent times due to the Covid 19 pandemic, most
        nations are still coping with the aftermath of this outbreak which has
        also affected the Forex Market badly with the rise and unpredictable
        sharp fall in the price and exchange rate of one currency to another.
        The Forex Market unlike the Crypto Currency is regulated by the Banking
        sector of the World in conjunction with the Banking system of various
        countries; it is well recognized and regulated to the fullest to support
        the financial institutions of the World. Trading in the Forex Market
        guarantees a high yielding income, however not as high yielding as the
        Crypto Trading or the Spot Trading security of funds. Both do not
        guarantee safety of funds or capital for investors as this could be lost
        during the trade, however, the ability to predict the outcome of the
        Crypto Trading is much more accurate than that of the Forex Market. In a
        bid to address the issue of loss and maximize profit, various
        organizations have resulted to using specialized trading bot which
        guaranteed daily income, and a reduced odd of losing to 0.015%.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">The Use of Trading Bot:</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        The use of Trading Bot brings to account the ease and accuracy of
        trading in the Crypto and Forex market, eradicating the need for skill
        acquisition and training, as well as the study of the trend and analysis
        of the market movement. With the use of the trading Bot, the market
        movement is well scrutinized using complex programming algorithm to
        actualize the profit and loss index of the market. The mode of trading
        is a bit like copy trading from
        <a href="https://www.hotforex.com" class="back-home"> Hot Forex </a> and
        <a href="https://www.FXTM.com" class="back-home"> FXTM </a> however
        guarantees profit making, and monitors the market to prevent loss in
        times of critical market fall. The Bot refrains from trading activities
        and saves money, preventing loss when the market is on a bearish run.
        The use of trading Bot is indeed very assuring and the ability to
        guarantee profit is also assuring, however companies which provides this
        service tends to request for an higher level of commission which could
        go as high as 50% tends limiting the output for the investors.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Trading on the online market duo of Crypto and Forex is risky, and does
        not guarantees safety of investors assets and capital, yet has the
        potential of booming positive financial output; with the use of Trading
        Bot, the potential of booming financial output is well maximize and the
        risk of losing trading capital is minimized.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">How Does Trading Bot Works</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        The trading Bot relies on a specific market trends mixed with algorithm
        to calculate the potential lose and gain ratio before opening a trade to
        maximize profit and minimize lose or eradicate the occurrence of such.
        Technical codes to fulfill this are put forth and an automated
        artificial intelligence identifies this trends to ascertain the
        possibility of making profit.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Are Trading Bot Profitable</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Trading bots are highly profitable and guarantees an high yield return
        on investment. The Bot which runs of a complex level of artificial
        intelligence is coded to identify all the market trends and can predict
        the bearish or bullish run to open trades and execute them, however
        could malfunction due to the integration of the Bot Algorithm to the
        trading scheme provider. There is also the issue of server going down
        and hacking as well, as the use of trade Bot would require the creation
        of a trading platform with its unique market monitoring trend chart
        connected to either a Meta 4 or Meta 5 trade graph to execute the trade,
        the complexity of creating and managing such a system is a major
        challenge.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Conclusively, trading Bot’s are guarantees maximized profit, and
        minimized loss ratio, however managing the platform is quite cumbersome,
        preventing hacks and an up all time server, things that should be
        considered before investing massively into trading platforms which
        guarantees the use of trading Bot.
