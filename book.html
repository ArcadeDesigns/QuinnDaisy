      <p class="post-text">
        The other family is a very great read containing thrills and a sense of
        passion luring reader’s interest with every step of the read. In this
        post well try our best not to give too much details or spoilers as the
        case maybe, but just enough information to give you a sensation of what
        to expect as you read this great book.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The very first thing you should note is that this book is written by
        Wendy Corsi Staub and published on Amazon Kindle EBook direct publishing
        , a link would be made available for the purchase of the hard cover or
        paperback copies. Moving further; have you ever wondered what makes a
        family unique? Is it the thrill of lust and love constantly conflicting
        one another or the face of deception and façade to mask the fear and
        childhood traumas or the panic of growing older or even the lost of a
        loved one? Ponder all day and all night sadly the answers are not just
        easy to put forth, in most cases the answers to such questions however
        many are shredded in mystery and a lot of contradictions that would
        leave you with more questions rather than answers. The other family
        entails the difficulty experienced by parent in the process of bringing
        up teenagers and reveals the truth of every adult past; “they were all
        teenagers once and had to navigate their way through the complexity of
        the transition to adulthood”.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The story begins with a family relocating from the rich side of Los
        Angeles to New York in a bid to enjoy some family time together with
        their two daughters who are preparing for a new live in high school and
        the other in college. The story opens with a lot of misgivings and a
        complex analysis and explanation of events and the deliberate omission
        of important details to create a sense of suspense and foreshadowing.
        The story moved further with the introduction of other various complex
        characters and the unsolved mystery of a murder which wiped out an
        entire family, and the rumours behind its mystery.
