      <h2 class="sub-heading">Reminders of Him by Colleen Hoover</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        The reality behind Love is cute and quite exhausting at the same time.
        What comes with Love is the complexity of acknowledging the
        vulnerability that this brings. Unfortunately we don’t choose who we
        fall in Love with and what’s more is the secret that could come along
        with it. This book is a very great read; the Reminders of Him by Colleen
        Hoover is wrapped in a complex plot and setting intended to bring out
        the best with the use of suspense and a tragic flow. The plot thickens
        as the read goes on with a complex character and the portray of feminism
        and control. In a bid to capture reader’s attention the novel makes good
        use of an Aside and hides details which slowly unravels along with its
        plot.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        It entails a very complex plot and a story meant to make readers stick
        to my phones and reading gadgets or even the book itself. Colleen Hoover
        a bestselling author truly puts into good use every writing skill stored
        up sleeve and released a very good classic, the right mix of tragedy,
        romance, and suspense with a great plot to support it flow.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        In this post, well discuss a bit about the novel without giving too much
        details or spoilers. The story starts with various details leading up to
        the Bar where Love is made. There is something unique about bar tenders
        and the way they move, pulling tricks on innocent customers and
        unsuspecting college girls on the summers holiday in the city, what’s
        ironic is; every bar tender has their moment of attraction, masters of
        tricks and flattery being drew into attractions themselves, that point
        where the room filled with drinks, drunks and repentant drunks stops
        receiving focus for a moment and then the quiet, sad looking beauty the
        very definition of a “Damsel In Distress” commands the attention and
        sits lonely writing in a diary and read memories from her past.
        Understand this, Love finds everyone in due time when they least expect
        it. However all Love story could something have a past, one so twisted
        and tragic, like the saying goes “its need to know” and anyone expecting
        gold could be sent off to an Heart break, imagine this, falling in Love
        with an ex-con, and what’s more complicated is when the pass mixed with
        tragedy connects two Lovers, and then the secrets begins to threaten the
        future, with a Murder by the corner, refusing to leave and refusing to
        stay.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Without giving too much details or any spoilers, experience tragic Love,
        unlike the story of Othello, or Romeo and Juliet, this story finds its
        Desdemona guilty of murder and its prince charming caught up in the mist
        of the whole affair. Simply put, Prince Charming knows the Murder victim
        and they might be more than friends, a part of the past she hoped was
        lost and buried in shreds of mysteries.
