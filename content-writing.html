        Generating incomes from content writing
      </h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Content writers are one of the most paid writers in the world; you get paid to do what you see as a passion, converted into a means of livelihood. When it comes to content writing, a wide range of knowledge concerning various aspects of life and topics affecting the world at large is required. Although there are various aspects of writing which generates as much income as content writing, to mention a few; report writing, writing of project thesis, writing a book, and many more, however this post is focused solely on Content Writing as this is also related to articles, web contents and blog posts, all needed in the process of managing a website or a blog. When it comes to writing various articles and website post or even blog post; the mix of content writing comes to light. Content writing is just like every other writing gig that requires a great length of research and understanding of the subject matter to ascertain full comprehension. If writing a report on a subject matter, trying to pass useful information and bring to light useful details of a forgotten knowledge or trend. The focus of content writing is advert placement, a medium of promoting a product, a style of product description.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Trying to differentiate between content writing and other writings can be quite tricky, however this maybe, all writing principles follows the same route, research, targeted audience, understanding the subject matter, and then the writing. For example, a blog created to support traveling and tourism, giving regular updates of international travels regulations and the best places to travel or visit in the summer, winter or spring, such post would definitely require a certain level as research, as it must be precise and be a vivid representation of what is reality and not what is expected. Content writing differs specifically in the aspect of its use, as this writing would include a descriptive post, explaining usage, product specifications and other aspect of what is being written about.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Writing Articles on the other hand is very much different as this requires in-depth analysis and detailed writing of what is expected to be written on. Articles are usually written to make understanding known and share an ideology, very different from content writing, however distinctive this maybe from content writing, articles are similar to it and can be generalized in line with all the writing aspect particularly related to web contents, blog posts and other online aspects of information dissemination.
