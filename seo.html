        The Impact of Meta Tags on Search Engine Optimization
      </h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        These are two keen words prominent in the web industry, particularly
        those involved in blogging and Website Development or Programmers. If
        you ask any blogger how they generate traffic to their websites, the
        very first thing any of them would say is through the use of Search
        Engine Optimization; sadly most of them are not aware of the fact that
        Search Engine Optimization (SEO) uses meta tags to generate traffic and
        ensure its flow. And if you ask any Web Developer or Programmer what
        Meta Tags are, they’ll probably say meta tags are very important in
        developing a website with a great deal of traffic either way, Meta Tags
        are the deal. This brings the question; what are Meta Tags? But before
        we discuss this let’s start with something more familiar;
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Understanding Search Engine Optimization</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Search engine optimization, also known as SEOs are a great way to ensure
        the continuous flow of traffic into any given website, in simple terms,
        SEOs are used to make the website visible and prominent on web searches,
        however this is not limited to the functions of the SEOs as writing a
        very good contents which meets the audience requirements would indeed
        pull in the required Traffic as well. Basically SEOs are very important
        as well as the content you post on your website.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">What Are Meta Tags</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Programmers and wed developers have no issue with this, as they are the
        expert in the use of SEOs, however there are some few experts who have
        dedicated their time to understanding just how this principles work with
        the intention to get the best out of this experience. Meta Tags are
        titles or Tagline used by Google search engine to locate topics and post
        on various websites relating to its users search and gives the best
        ranking result. Let’s say you wrote a topic on Making Online Money
        through affiliate Marketing, your Meta Tags, particularly, the Meta Tag
        Description, Meta Tags Keyword would read something like this;
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        “Everything you need to know about Affiliate Marketing | Affiliate
        Marketing and Diversification of Web Income | Affiliate Marketing |
        Generate passive income through Affiliate Marketing”.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">The Use of Meta Tags</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Meta Tags are what you need to get your website top ranking on searches
        relating to its post. However the use of Meta Tags follows some certain
        rules and would require some certain degree of knowledge, in its
        specifications in other to be fully functional.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        For a Meta Tag Description or Keyword to be fully functioning, it
        dictates that you have a word matching up to various sentences with a
        spacing column of 165. To calculate this you would need to use a Notepad
        to monitor your Tag Descriptions and Keywords. Upon writing a Meta Tag
        that reaches these requirements, then it is placed on in the website or
        web post Meta Tag in the head section of the website with the following
        Tag extensions; description, keyword, og:description, og:keyword. To get
        the best out of the Meta Tag, it is advisable to use various sentences
        and keywords in these different sections of the Meta Tag.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        At this point I will state that Meta Tags are very important in running
        your website SEOs and traffic flow. Meta Tags are used by Goggle in
        ranking your website and gaining popularity, the more individuals and
        users visit you website, the higher your rankings on Google and the more
        likely you are to getting search hit every time a user searches on
        topics relating to post you’ve written on, or are affiliated to on your
        website. This automatically translates into traffic which would help you
        grow your website traffic and meet the required audience. However if
        your website is not self hosting or self constructed, this can be
        difficult to use as Meta Tags would require a certain level of knowledge
        in regards to website development. Take for example; trying to use Meta
        Tags for a BlogSpot web page or WordPress site can be difficult and
        tricky. For BlogSpot, they provide you with an option to add tags to
        your post, however lovely this is, it is not as effective as the use of
        Meta Tags which gives you the ability to target your search in line with
        prominent search words and topics relating to your post. WordPress sites
        on the other hand, would require you to have a paid subscription to
        effectively use Meta Tags on your website, which ever the choice may be
        Meta Tags are very important regardless.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">
        The Role of Social Media in Search Engine Optimization
      </h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        After writing your Meta Tags and launching your post, it is not enough
        to sit back and do nothing, as you would still be required to promote
        latest post on various social media platforms, except if you have worked
        on you site for some time and have users who would share latest post on
        various Social Media platforms without you raising a finger. To
        compensate this also, you can make use of subscription to send out
        Newsletters on latest updates and post through Email Services. You can
        also decide to make your services required enough to automatically
        generate traffic even without sharing post on any Social Media platform,
        which ever choice is made, SEOs would still require the use of Meta
        Tags, shares on various Social Media Platforms, effective Contents and
        effective service delivery.
