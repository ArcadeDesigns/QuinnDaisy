      <h2 class="sub-heading">CCPA and GPRA policies</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        When it comes to website policies concerning the usage and collection of
        data, there are certain policies to put in mind, ranging from the Terms
        of Usage and Services to Cookie Policies, Privacy Policies, or
        Disclaimer post, all this details are necessary and very important. In
        line with the monetization of content, specifically in relation to
        Google Adsense approval, these policies are very crucial. Various
        bloggers and Website mangers have resulted to the use of various advert
        agencies and organizations other than Google Adsense to ensure
        monetization their post or web content in hopes to earn from traffic and
        clicks as well as impression, this agencies ranges from each other, to
        mention a few, Propeller Ads, Adsterra, or even Google Adsense. All this
        agencies are used in the process of monetization of websites and blog
        contents however their rates and method of applications differs from
        each other. For example, Propeller Ads offers a wide range of services
        however are prone to showing adverts of X rated contents, while
        Adsterra, dishes out rate which are incredibly low in remuneration, this
        leaves most bloggers and website managers with Google Adsense which
        requires tedious processes to get approved for Ads viewing on various
        websites.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Google Adsense is known to give out extremely high rate on clicks,
        impressions and traffic. The rates generated by Google Adsense are the
        highest in the service of Ads placement on websites and blogs; for every
        1000 clicks $4.5 would be added to the account, if this is calculated by
        100,000 clicks that would bring in $405 with a monthly payout clause,
        the more reasons to generate organic traffic and avoid plagiarism of
        contents and images as plagiarism and fake clicks are major reason for
        the rejection or suspension of a website in the Adsense program. The
        process of Google Adsense approval required for admission into the
        Adsense program ranges from the following requirements that must have
        been met by the website before application. The requirement includes: a
        minimum of 20 posts on the website and this post must be 100% authentic
        and free of plagiarism, at least three month of operations for the
        website to be approved, and the most important are the Privacy Policies.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        When it comes to privacy policies, Google Adsense doesn’t joke with
        this, the reason not far fetch though. Most websites would require its
        audience or users to enter certain personal details into web forms or
        subscription boxes, information’s like passwords, gender, account
        number, card details and more are inputted into this websites which are
        uploaded to the data base and could be sold off upon extraction, or used
        in the process of massive bank and financial fraudulent transactions.
        Either way, guaranteeing the safety of your Audience and Users is very
        important as this would prevent the occurrence of massive bank and
        financial fraudulent.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        In a bid to get Google Adsense approval, as much as the contents
        published and the Management of the websites are important and
        compulsory, also the assurance of users privacy and security of their
        personal details is also vehement as Google Adsense won’t approve a
        website with plagiarism or fake traffic and most important without the
        Privacy Policy notifications or arrangements. The privacy policies are
        so important, even certain Ads agencies and affiliate marketing platform
        won’t admit websites or blogs without this assurance. In the case of
        Google Adsense, beyond the Privacy Policies, Terms of Service and
        Disclaimer post, there are two Privacy Policies that should be added in
        the privacy policy section, GPRA policies for users from the EU and the
        California Privacy Policy quote (CCPA and GPRA policies). The CCPA
        (California Privacy Policy) is in line with the California Law, which
        protects residence of California from illegal activities and falling
        victims to illegal websites. This policies are used to make websites and
        blogs liable to law actions if found in contempt of this laws and ensure
        its users and residence protection. It also helps the Adsense program to
        ascertain serious Websites from the fake ones seeking to gather users
        information.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Conclusively, if you are hoping to start a website or blog, where your
        contents would be monetirized for the traffic and impressions generate,
        then you must certainly put this in mind, and carry out all the
        necessary research needed to understand this policies, write one and
        upload it to your Privacy Policy on your website or blog, to guarantee
        users from the EU and California of the security of their privacy.
