      <h2 class="sub-heading">Google Adsense</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Web blogging seems to be a lucrative business flooding the internet with
        various blog site created with content monetization being the major aim.
        However this process could sometimes be tricky as most individuals are
        known to be money oriented at the detriment of original and professional
        content and information to be passed.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Web blogging is prominently used to discuss and promote personal views
        and ideas concerning various topics. Making money from intellectual
        content should however not be the aim as it could hamper productivity
        and the influence hoped to be achieved, a major reason for Googleâ€™s
        policy, terms and condition for the approval of a website or web blog to
        running advert campaigns and earn money.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Running adverts on personal blogs and website could surely be a high
        yield reward process which focus on reward for professional content with
        various agencies in support of this to mention a few; Adsterra Propeller
        Ads Google Adsense and even affiliate marketing programs like Amazon
        Affiliate, however our focus is solely on Google Adsense. After a survey
        taken it was determined that a grossing $1000 could be gotten daily from
        the monetization of web blog or website content which are considered to
        be professional, and original as well as having the capacity to attract
        a massive load of organic traffic to the web blog. With this figure, if
        an individual makes 10 posts in a day and generates 10,000 organic
        traffic on each post the individual could very much rail in thousands of
        dollar bills in a single day numbering to millions in naira, little
        wonder young industrious Nigerians are trooping into the business.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        However to rake in such high amount of income specific factors are to be
        considered with the first being the Originality of the content or post.
        Originality is a major consideration by the Google adsense team to
        ensure post from other sources are not stolen and used to generate
        traffic and get paid. Also the team scrutinize for the use of invalid
        traffic usually purchased online. Such act could sometimes lead to the
        deactivation, banning or suspension of the Google adsense programs and
        services on the site or blog.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Another factor to look out for is the number of post on the web blog as
        this could also very much affect the activation process of Google
        Adsense on a web blog. For newly developed or activated web sites and
        web blogs, a certain number of posts should be reached before
        considering applying for Goggle Adsense.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Before websites can be eligible to host adverts, a certain degree and
        level of professionalism must be met, and this include a 404 error page,
        a terms of usage and mission post or pages and a purchased domain name
        which is highly important in the process of running adverts on a web
        blog.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        However these factors are just few of the many policies and term and
        conditions to be met as stated by Google adsesne and it would be
        advisable to visit their web site to confirm for other policies, terms
        and conditions to be met before starting a blog or purchasing a website.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Pros of Using Google Adsense</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        For individuals who are familiar with the operation of Goggle Adsense,
        then one conclusion is certain, Adsense is very lucrative and the payout
        is also massive as well, also you can make use of Google analysis to
        track the flow of traffic, not to mention Google Adsense role in the
        promote of post content on the website and other amazing Google tools to
        use in the pursuit of a successful web blogging career. Ultimately
        Google Adsense would be highly recommended for the process of content
        monetization of web blog post, not to mention it would invariable
        promote professionalism.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Cons of Using Google Adsense</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Apart from the time frame and difficulty encountered in the process of
        getting Google Adsense approval on a blog or a web site, Adsense would
        very much build blogging skill and till this moment uphold the quality
        of web contents to ensure professionalism.
