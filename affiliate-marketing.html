        Diversifying Online Income through Product Marketing
      </h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        If you ask any website manager or blogger how they generate sustainable
        income from post and contents on their websites or blogs, most of them
        would tell you, it’s actually the result of advertising as the major
        source of income, monetization of traffic, or getting personalized
        advert contracts etc. Advert placement on web contents and blog post can
        be indeed lucrative with the generation of passive and sustainable
        income. However, this would have to deal with the use of Search Engine
        Optimization (S.E.O) and promotion for new website keen to establish
        their dominance of the World Wide Web and for older websites or blogs
        hoping to maintain relevance, the publishing of exquisite contents
        guaranteed to generate massive traffic, or the use of promotions on
        various social media spaces using Hash Tags and directing the contents
        to targeted audience, some go as far as sending emails and direct
        messages just to get the desired flow of traffic, however this
        principles may apply, it goes not always guarantee an increase in
        traffic flow to a website or blog post; if anything, writing an
        informative, plagiarism free, well articulated post would do better to
        address this issues, as long as it as a targeted audience in view.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Another problem with the use of Advert agencies is the time taken to get
        approval for both new and old websites owning to the problem of contents
        and policies. Advert agencies like Google Adsesne, and the likes would
        scrutinize websites and blogs submitted to them and afterwards reject
        their offers with no credible reason in the emails sent or the Adsense
        account leaving website managers and bloggers to scamper for help in the
        most unlikely manner and unlikely place, not to mention the operational
        duration needed for a website or blog to have been operated before
        considering applying for Adsense. For new websites and blogs hoping to
        start generating income as soon as possible, applying for Google Adsense
        is not an option. Adsense takes pride in its post of various webpage’s
        and would require a certain level of traffic, post as well as
        authenticity of post before approval, also the number of months in
        operation is a requirement. For website within a month old or three of
        publication or establishment, it can be very difficult to get Adsense
        approval and even if older than eight month, there is still the issue of
        meeting up with the cookie policies and privacy policies of Adsense,
        with two keen policies to look out for which are;
      </p>

      <ul class="post-text">
        <li>
          California Advertising Policies (California Consumer Privacy Act)
        </li>
        <li>European Union User Consent Policy</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="post-text">
        However difficult this may be, it is not impossible, all it requires are
        deliberate research on how to set up a privacy policy content that suits
        this requirements.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Affiliate Marketing</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Applying for affiliate marketing is a very easy and is a lucrative means
        of income, Website managers and bloggers who are into affiliate
        marketing have ended up with pocket filled wealth and testimonies of its
        effectiveness. The very first thing to be on the lookout for is the
        Audience, as this goes a long way in generating traffic and a perfect
        passive income. The targeted audience would determine the contents to be
        written on the websites and the post on the blog, a major determinant
        used by Adsense in placing adverts on a Website. These principles also
        goes along with that of Affiliate Marketing, if a Website is built
        solely to give updates on tech and programming, then for affiliate
        marketing, agencies like Amazon, Vana-Plus, Jumia, and the likes that
        offer this services should be the target, if it is a blog established to
        give updates of trending topics, and post individual articles capable of
        getting content writing gig and the likes, affiliate program like
        Fiverr, or Upwork should be considered, and if you hope to promote
        Ebooks or an online Library Resource, Amazon Kindle should not be left
        out of the mix.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Apart from the Audience is the content, as most individuals would never
        waste time reading contents which are irrelevant or lack didactism,
        therefore any post or article published should be professional,
        informative and free of plagiarism or vocabulary inefficiencies.

      <p class="post-text">

        writes, having to write contents, or articles for blog post or websites

        however other consider this to be quite difficult and requires a certain
