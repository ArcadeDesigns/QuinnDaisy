        The Power Tussle between Modern Capitalist States and a Socialist
        Ideology
      </h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Ideologies like Capitalism and Socialism are experimental forms of
        Economical and Political systems of Government which may or may not
        succeed upon application. Understanding the whole insight into its
        operation as a system would explain why the concept of alignment and
        support for an international bloc maybe important in the process of
        guaranteeing Sovereignty and Human Right, in understanding the in depth
        analysis of the conflict ongoing in Eastern Europe presently.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        It’s no news, the world has been at war at various point in history with
        the reasons for this not far fetch, ranging from the ideological
        difference of states, to the thirst for power, and the will to test
        military might; in the words of Aristotle a great philosopher, summed up
        all this into one quote after studying over two hundred and fifty (250)
        constitutions of various state;
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        “The reason for mans continuous revolution is the need for equality”
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        If equality is what man desires and this assertion is correct, then the
        World will continue to have revolutions and wars in a bid to satisfy a
        man’s thirst for equality; which could be compounded by the ideological
        believe of Fascism, Nazism, or Totalitarianism. Any form of this
        ideology would definitely set the state on a coalition course with the
        World; a critical look at most men who stated global conflicts would
        reveal that they were all intoxicated by power, thus;
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        “Violence is the last resort for men with power and the first resort for
        men drunk with power”
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        It is no doubt violence is always key to settling long years of
        disagreement in International Politics with reference to the World Wars
        and upon improvement, the Cold War, a War fought in secret and in
        silence.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Dated back to the period of Napoleon, drunk with power and in pursuit to
        enforce his authority believing in an ideology, conformed to wage war
        thought-out Europe in the sixteenth century (16th century) till he met
        his waterloo at the battle of waterloo. In a bid to address the problem
        of intoxication and prevent the start of another global conflict, the
        concert of Europe was formed, however with little or no understanding of
        what Global Politics seemed like and failed terribly in keeping Global
        Peace, over the year the First World War broke out and led to the
        creation of the League of Nation, this time an organization with a
        systematic approach to solving the problems and issues of the world in
        relation to Global Politics and Foreign Policies but failed woefully in
        preventing the proliferation of Armed and Ammunition, a key note of
        Aristotle Ideology “Equality”. If Equality was a curse, then definitely,
        the World at various points in time is bound to encounter the likes of
        Napoleon, Adolf Hitler or Benito Mussolini. The Concert of Europe, the
        League of Nations and now the United Nations, all of the same role,
        difference in structure, ideological believe and systematic approach to
        solving Global Issues, however I want to point out that until the issue
        of Arms Proliferation is checked, the world will continue to get
        involved in conflicts.

      <p class="post-text">
        Understanding that the need to checkmate the strength of Super Powers,
        however mighty and strong they might be still needs nations to survive
        and Economic, Socio-Cultural interaction to remain relevant, the United
        Nations opted for the creation of specific organs to cater for specific
        issues and in the case of a failure of any organ, the Security Council
        of the United Nations steps in to enforce its Verdict. However this is
        not enough to solve the issue of proliferation as every nation of the
        world would in one way or the other try to achieve equality with the
        Super Powers, pointing to Economic might, and Military Strength, (Hard
        power and Soft power), in doing this, the need for Equality they would
        clamour is to checkmate the Super Powers as the existence of a group of
        countries to control the affairs of the World and disregarding
        Sovereignty is not proper; However the process of attaining Hard or Soft
        power is not proper either; in the 18th century the process was through
        slave trade, and the 19th century was through exploitation and
        colonialism, while in the 20th and 21st century is termed
        Neo-Colonialism. Whichever way it is describe, for nations of the World
        to be equal, decades of selfish Foreign Policies would be formulated,
        leading to decades of Revolution. However one major answer to the
        problem of Equality and Global Conflicts is the stop of Proliferation of
        Arms and Ammunition.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Science and Technology seems to be growing exponentially, however if the
        focus of the growth is shifted to Military Strength and remain fixed on
        it, there is the emergence of first; Anarchy, then the proliferation to
        challenge a Super Power and then the War and at the end of it, Super
        Powers would stand, particular those who fought and survived.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Putting all this into account would give a proper understanding of the
        result which would be a system of alignment to a super power or the
        other; in the cause of the World presently, the Capitalist State or the
        Socialist State.

        The Power Tussle between Modern Capitalist State and a Socialist
        Ideology
      </h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        The ideology of Capitalism, however noble, has its white sheet tinted by
        the red ink of Foreign Policies, which are usually clouded in selfish
        attribute and favouring the country of origin. Indeed, it guaranteed
        Sovereignty, and Democracy, and respect for human right to the utmost
        end, but still as its sheets stained. While the Socialist State, as a
        bit of Anarchy, less regard for human right and supports the doctrine of
        Fascism; two systems with imperfection, one as to be chosen. The world
        has been torn apart by the support for this ideology, particularly, the
        expansion of the Capitalist Ideology which seems to be encroaching into
        the Socialist space. The Economic and Political system of Government
        which supports the private ownership of the means of production,
        distribution and exchange of services in a country, as well as
        government ownership of huge business with massive capitals requirement
        is indeed a very profitable source for income generation. The system
        gives private businesses an opportunity to grow with limited government
        intervention and lenient economic policies, with huge respect for human
        right and personal opinions. The Capitalist state indeed connotes, the
        Government willingness and ability to help create a society that respect
        every part of human right ad living conditions. The system of Socialism
        on the other hand is the direct opposite of Capitalism and believes in
        the Government control of the crucial businesses in the State, unlike
        Fascism or Totalitarianism that seeks Government control of every aspect
        of the citizen life, Socialism seeks to control the means of production,
        distribution and exchange of services provided in the state. The two
        systems with their perks and disadvantages are considered to be the only
        systems in use in the world. The Capitalist states constitute a large
        part of the Allied force which fought in the First World War and Second
        World War and till this day hold a strong military alliance. While the
        Socialist Ideology, fading slowly, to be replaced by the ideology of a
        Democratic Socialism, a gloried form of Capitalism. The Power Tussle
        between Modern Capitalist State and a Socialist Ideology a well fought
        war of ideology, sadly, the policies and ideologies of Capitalism seems
        to be gaining the upper hand and history has its record set and fixed on
        the glories of the great Ideologies of Capitalism.

        Understanding the Conflict ongoing in Eastern Europe: The Expansion of
        Capitalist Ideology
      </h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        After critical scrutiny of the whole factors involved in a bid to
        understand the Conflict ongoing in Eastern Europe and why violence is
        the last answer to global threats, as well as the Power Tussle between
        Modern Capitalist States and a Socialist Ideology.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        The encroachment of Capitalist Ideology in a bid to gain global
        acceptance and prominence the true stature of Global Power, is being
        opposed by one of the last remaining holder of Socialist ideology, and
        studying the pattern of Media control, and information dissemination of
        the former USSR, connotes Fascist doctrines, which could very much be
        the start of another global conflict, if not checked properly.
