        International Politics Hampering Ukraine’s Hope for Salvation
      </h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        When it comes to the foreign sphere of nations and the assembly in court
        to pursue foreign policy and promote national interest, objects of
        thoughts like treaties, diplomatic ties, alliance, and espionage comes
        to light. However secretive this principles maybe and kept far away from
        public view and public reach, the fact remains that it still exist and
        constitute a big part of the world survival and maintenance of global
        peace and fostering of global unity. Countries of the world at one time
        or the other resulted to unconventional means to fulfill their foreign
        policy and satisfy its national interest, however selfish it may sound
        the principle of foreign policy dictate national interest first and
        everything else.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        In the case of the conflict presently ravaging Eastern Europe, it is
        filled with mixed reactions and trolling details of what maybe a mistake
        and security laps or protection of territorial integrity as it is no
        longer News, the steps Russia as taken to fulfill and satisfy its
        national interest; in this case alleged defense of territorial integrity
        from alleged Western incursion.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        The issue on going in Eastern Europe; “The Invasion of Ukraine by
        Russia” as seen the European Union come together under one voice to
        condemn this act of violence and unprovoked aggression. Sadly the world
        is divided on this issue, the views of some blaming the western media
        for extensive report on the issue trying to stir up sympathy vote, while
        other relating to the issue of humanitarian crises stemming from the
        conflict and the reality of being trapped in a war zone, however this
        realities maybe the fact remains we are human first and every act of
        violence and aggression is a stain on the world history’s never to be
        wiped off or forgotten.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Ukraine, the victim of this violent aggression has cried out for help
        hoping the western allies, NATO, and the EU would rush to its aid, sadly
        this is not the case, two months into the conflict and Ukraine is left
        alone to fend off the invading Russian Forces and protects its
        territorial integrity from this incursion while NATO and the EU
        continues to place crippling sanctions on Russia.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Like history repeating itself, but in this case the Germans and Russians
        were actors from a scene in the second war world (WW II) play book under
        Hitler and Stalin respectively, in what was seen as a movement to attack
        an enemy through the Russian border known as the USSR (United Sovereign
        Socialist Republics) at the time of this event turned out to be an
        attack on them and invaded deep into their territory crippling the
        Russian Forces to a near defeat. Of course International relations was
        there ready to play its role in the area of alliance under the allied
        force which fought the Germans for the majority of the Second World War
        (WW II) until the end as since change its rules of engagement.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">The Role of International Politics</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        International politics, a fancy name for foreign policy as established
        the fact that a country only establish bilateral or multilateral
        relations when it favor either parties or both parties economically or
        promises to promote science and technology, either way, there is always
        a gain. Pursuing National Interest at the global scene is every
        countries foreign policy and a major guide in international relations or
        international politics, how countries trade with one another, relates
        with one and another, joins or exit a global or regional bloc, establish
        alliance, regulate price during international trade, all are guides in
        international politics. Understanding how all this policies affects
        relationship would indeed help one understand why NATO and the EU as opt
        for sanctions rather than an all out conflict in a bid to safe Ukraine
        from Russian aggression. Basically the war going on in Europe could
        spill into a global crisis if not checked with proper care, and the
        attempt to avoid the incidence of global war has been a step well taken
        to rather sanction Russia and cripple its ability to wage war, if this
        succeed then we could see an end to what could spill into a global
        conflict which would most certainly guarantee the use of Nuclear weapons
        among Super Powers.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">
        Ukraine past Global Influence and the Path to Join the Capitalist Nation
      </h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Ukraine used to be a part of the USSR and was at one point in time the
        third largest nuclear power in the world until it signed a deal with the
        United States and Russia where is relinquished all its Nuclear power for
        the assurance of safety and security as well as Territorial Integrity to
        practice its system of government as a sovereign independent nation.
        However its historical background of being a former Socialist state
        still haunts its ambition to be a part of NATO and establish a strong
        alliance with the United States. This is coupled with the fact that the
        United States respect the sovereignty of European Countries and their
        stance against external incursion as an attack to one is an attack to
        all, making them strong when united and a terror for any invading force.
        There is also the fact that Ukraine tying to be a part of the Capitalist
        Bloc would mean a neighboring Capitalist state bordering Russia, send
        with a strong warning of NATO alliance backing them up, this rivalry
        would send Russia military strength sinking and as rules are set in
        International trades with National Currencies being a legal tender, in
        international politics, power, either soft or Hard power (Military
        Strength), is the currency for dominance and maintenance of economic
        power in the World. As a result it is not hard to fathom Russia claim of
        Capitalist incursion and the United States fears of a United Europe
        fighting its agenda for expansion. Furthermore, there is the fear of
        Military alliance between Ukraine and the United States, which reminds
        the world of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia just some few years back
        in 2014, which led to the annexation of the Crimean region by Russia. If
        Ukraine was a part of NATO or was in a military alliance with the United
        States, Russia won’t dare to invade Ukraine, plus there is the risk of
        an all out war where Russia would be caught in the middle of a NATO
        force and EU alliances.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">
        Economic Sanctions Placed on Russia and its Effect on the EU
      </h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Every countries life line would be its Economic Strength, with a strong
        economy; a country can wage war for decades, purchase weaponries, and
        create sophisticated advanced technologies capable of mass destruction,
        if Ukraine was to be a part of NATO, imagine just how easy it would be
        for the United States to carry out espionage and economic sabotage in
        Russia, a great fear for one of Europe’s power house and second
        strongest military in the world. Thus buttressing Russia’s fears once
        more. And on the part of the European Union, a direct confronted with
        Russia would mean the cutoff of gas supply to a majority of European
        countries and a great defect on Russia’s economy but a greater disaster
        for the European Countries. As earlier stated the annexation of the
        Crimean Region back in 2014 was a well contested events that led to a
        victory for Russia, however there are still many regions being contested
        for in Ukraine, and as a result Russia can boldly move into this regions
        with its military might in a bid to annex more Ukrainian regions, as
        long as it remains out of NATO and any other military alliance, thus the
        annexation of more Ukrainian territory by Russia in the spirit of a
        military conquest through territorial encroachment would satisfy Russia
        expansion dreams and one step to forming its USSR glory days once more
        with large deposit of natural resources.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        After the Second World War (WW II) outcome, two super powers, The United
        States and its allies, and the USSR came into play, and ushered in a new
        dispensation, the Cold War era fought across countries and continents in
        the shadow space away from public views, using espionage as a tool for
        Economic sabotage, Military sabotage, technological sabotage and covert
        cover ups at the end of it all. These countries fought for global
        supremacy and this fight was unending until the late 70s when the word
        saw global co-operation and unity for many years until this moment.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        In conclusion, the thought of a global conflict is quite scary and so is
        the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the killings of civilians is also
        heart breaking. The EU and NATO as decided economic crippling sanctions
        on Russia, however there are fears that this may not be enough and
        Ukraine may fall into Russia’s hands. The place of International
        Politics in all this is the policy of Non-Aggression towards an
        Aggressive state like Russia already using military force in Ukraine
        with a subtle question on the mind of expert analyst and Political,
        Military and Global Politics experts;
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        What if Ukraine falls and Russia turns its eyes towards Poland which is
        a part of NATO, would there be an all out War or would it still be
        Economic Sanctions?
