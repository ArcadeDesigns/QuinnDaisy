        Why you should Choose Python Programming Language
      </h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        The term programming Language is nothing new to the world, and if you
        are into tech or have recently made an enquiry or research about a
        website, Mobile and software development, the term becomes obsolete,
        however fleeting upon review of past knowledge and thing learnt. The
        term Programming Language explains the systematic process and algorithm
        involved in the creation of system software or mobile applications,
        however complex it may be is not beyond understanding. When it comes to
        this filed, there are various branches and subsections to it, picking
        the one best to learn can be quite difficult putting into consideration
        the various requirements and reasons for learning them with the ultimate
        consideration of the path to becoming a professional programmer, either
        a junior, senior or full stack professional can be quite lengthy, time
        consuming and complex.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Programming Languages and the complexities that comes with them can be
        discouraging; however the outcome and professional purview on the other
        hand, can definitely be the opposite of discouragement with one major
        advantage of the massive income generation opportunity. When it comes to
        programming there are various aspects to consider and when it comes to
        the choice of the best programming language to learn in a bid to become
        an expert or professional programmer also complex and complicated just
        as the process to learning is. As a result, we’ll look into a simple
        Language to learn and its important directories. Programming in this
        post would be divided into the basic categories and sub categories to
        guarantee effective understanding on the choice of Programming Language.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Front End Development</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Front end development is regarded as one of the easiest and often cases
        described as the beginner’s stage, the front end development consist of
        HTML and CSS, as well as JavaScript, the simple basics of Website
        Development. Understanding how the Front End Development works should be
        the first priority of any aspiring developer before forging forward to
        learn the complexities of the Back End Development. One major advantage
        of learning the front end development is that in Provides aspiring
        developers with the opportunity to understand the process of Algorithm
        and systems operations.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Back End Development</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        The Back end Development Covers details of how a program should
        function. In the Back End Development, objects like the server side,
        database and functionality are cover. It is the combined understanding
        of the Front End Development and Back End Development as well as the
        Database that makes an individual a full stack developer, while
        extensive understanding of a particular aspect of the Back End
        development is what makes an individual a senior programmer due to the
        lack of vast knowledge specifically in the Database aspect. The Back End
        aspect of Programming also consists of various programs like: Rust,
        Ruby, Python, Java, C#, C++, Django, PHP, or even JavaScript, mastery of
        one of this language is required to become a Back End Developer.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Choosing a Programming Language</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        It has been established that learning the Front End trio of HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript is not optional but mandatory; however selecting a
        language to learn from the Back End aspect can be quite tricky, with one
        solution; understanding the strength and weakness of this Programming
        Language. For example, if you are looking into Android App Development,
        the Programs that should be considered would be, Kotlin, Java and
        KivyMD. Kotlin and Java are similar in structure, with Kotlin being the
        Advance version of Java, like a Java 2.0, while KivyMD is a directory of
        Python used for Mobile App Development. Understanding the specific field
        of interest would be the first step to go in choosing a programming
        Language to Learn and in this case, we choose Python Programming
        Language. I would also like to state that there is no way to ascertain
        the best programming language overall, as all languages are incredible
        in their own ways and different in usage.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Python Programming</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Python Programming Language is mainly used for Software Development with
        various directory used to ensure its functionality. The Python
        Programming Language is by far the most demanded Programming Language
        according to
        <a
          href="https://www.webiotic.com/why-should-you-choose-python-for-mobile-app-development/"
          class="back-home"
        >
          Webiotic Statistics
        </a>
        accounting for more than 60 percent of software development job
        opportunities in the United States. What makes Python Programming a
        highly demanded skill is its ability to run across multiple platforms
        and adaptation as the most widely used Software Development platform
        with various libraries to help it achieve this feet. In this post, we
        will examine three major Python Libraries; PyQt5, KivyMD, TKinter
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">PyQt5</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        Recently updated and released library of Python Programming comes with
        its own emulator, Designer. The python Designer is used to set up the
        user interface of Python Programming making the process easier, faster
        and evading the myriads of codes to be written t achieve such feet. With
        PyQt5 Designer, Python Programmers can seamlessly write a full user
        interface code within numbers and make ever necessary database testing
        using SQLite.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">KivyMD</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        As earlier mentioned in this post, the KivyMD library is used for the
        development of Mobile Applications, which upon conversion can run as an
        SDK or APK file on Android devices, however a lengthy process as this
        would require the use of Django, Bulldozer and a Linux Operating system.
        Using KivyMD in Android App creation however is just as effective as the
        use of Kotlin or Java, and like PyQt5 Designer, has its own Emulator, to
        test for bugs and run codes before purchasing as an SDK or APK file.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">TKinter</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        This library is an obsolete Python Library, used to designer System
        Applications in the past, it’s still effect though, but obsolete and
        lacks an Emulator like the PyQt5 designer, which would invariably
        require longer and more lengthy period of time develop a full fledge
        System Software.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">Other libraries in Python Programming include</p>

      <p class="post-text">
        Pygame, PyMath, SimpleGUI, the list goes on, making Python Language
        versatile and capable of meeting both System Software Development
        requirements and Mobile App Development requirements.
