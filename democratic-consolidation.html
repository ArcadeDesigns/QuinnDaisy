      <p class="post-text">
        Nigeria over the years has been an exemplary image of democracy on the
        African continent upholding every principles of its system which
        includes; the principles of the fundamental human right, in line with
        the universal declaration (UDHR, 1945), the principles of legitimacy,
        independence of the judiciary and the electoral commission, as well as
        the conduct of a free and fair periodic election. Dated back to the year
        1999, after years of military rule, Nigeria conducted an election which
        brought in the first democratically elected president, retired General
        Chief Olusegun Obasanjo into the office of the presidency, for a two
        term tenure. Under his rule, Nigeria experienced a lot of growth and
        development spanning from his rule to the rule of the late Umar Yara
        Dua, and that of the former president, Ebele Goodluck Jonathan and the
        incumbent president retired General Muhammadu Buhari. Although every
        elected president of the nation as added their quota to the growth of
        democracy in Nigeria as well as ensure its continuity in the nation and
        beyond, enjoying various levels of international co-operation and
        integration as a result of this effort, Nigeria’s role in democratic
        consolidation on the African continent can never be over emphasized.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        However, in recent years, the nation has been bedeviled with various
        challenges to spanning from the political sector to the economic sector
        and the socio-cultural aspect of the country. Politically, Nigeria was
        once described as a “fantastically corrupt nation” by the former British
        Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, not far fetch though as this is due to
        the depth of corruption in various ministries of the country with most
        state actors and political head, having their hands in the cookie jar.
        Economically, Nigeria was once recognized as the fastest growing economy
        on the African Continent, with the highest Gross Domestic Production
        (GDP) ratio on the same African continent overtaking South Africa in the
        leadership seat., however this claims have been questioned following
        series of economic woes that as encountered the country ranging from the
        high cost of production, to the high cost of living, to high inflation
        rate and an increase in the unemployment ratio to the fall of the Naira,
        Nigeria’s national currency to the Dollar. Some may argue that the
        reason for this could be linked to the global drop in the price of crude
        oil, which is Nigeria’s major source of revenue, the truth remains that
        the country is facing a lot of economic hardship. Although there have
        been efforts by the Government to diversify the country’s economy with
        the creation of indigenous factories to process local Agricultural
        Produce and partnering with foreign companies and nations to improve the
        exportation of some of this agricultural produce which includes; Cotton,
        Cocoa, Palm Oil, Ground Nuts, Cashew Nuts and so on. In the year 2020
        alone, Nigeria export 321.5 billion naira worth of agricultural
        products, however this impressive improvement was met by an increase in
        Importation, which impacted the country’s economy negatively. Sadly even
        with all this achievements, every economic prosperity seems to be down
        the drain, with human right guarantee at its lowest, and an increased
        clamour for separation from secessionist, there is also an outcry
        against the Nigerian police force, particularly, the special anti
        robbery squad (SARS) for illegal extortion, and inhumane treatment of
        innocent citizens, and with an increase in insecurity, kidnapping and
        banditry in the country, one may wonder what is the future of Nigeria’s
        Democratic consolidation as every principles of democracy are not being
        held, and the future of the country is still very much uncertain.

        According to Abraham Lincoln, Democracy is the government of the people
        for the people and by the people. A closer scrutiny of the statement
        points towards the reality that democracy is simply the government of
        the people., and in line with that to guarantee, full democracy in a
        country, the government must be legitimate, with periodic election and
        an independent electoral commission and an Independent Judiciary, sadly
        reverse in the case in Nigeria, with mass corruption and compromise of
        duty, Nigeria’s democratic consolidation is hanging by a thread, sadly
        the federal government has become too powerful and too dangerous to
        remain as such. A notable example would be the electoral act amendment
        bill which was vetoed by the President retired General Nuhammadu Buhari.
        Nigeria’s democratic consolidation is slowly slipping away and with the
        2023 general election by the corner, the fear of many concerning the
        result and aftermath of the elections has risen. First is in the issue
        of insecurity. The Nigerian Military has been battling with the Islamic
        terrorist group, the Boko Haram Insurgents, since 2009, which has
        metamorphosed into the Islamic State of west African province (ISWAP),
        with no external aid of troops, and to add to it is the issue of
        Banditry which has become a menace, out of control with kidnapping now a
        lucrative means of income for this recently labelled terrorist group,
        the Nigerian Military is straight thin, and with the Nigerian Police
        Force incapable of facing this menace or that of the secessionist group
        in the west and eastern part of Nigeria, insecurity is guarantee at an
        all time high could spell doom for the 2023 General Election. Democracy
        guarantees’ the majority rule and the minority supports, however serving
        as a watchdog to prevent autocratic rule as been negated by statements
        like the kings maker turn to rule, the issue of God fathers in politics.
        The issue of godfatherism, a dependent electoral commission and a
        dependent judiciary which is the last hope of the common man. The
        legitimacy of the government that will assume office after the 2023
        general election might be said to be less legitimate. If the future
        election ids having some many future fears already how can Nigeria’s
        democracy be guaranteed?
