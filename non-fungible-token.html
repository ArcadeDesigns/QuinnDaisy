        A Trending Crypto Trade to Survive Economic Status
      </h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Crypto currency and the continuous hope of financial income and
        unlimited wealth, ranging from the prospect of holding to trading is
        still very much believed by some to be the breakthrough they need.
        Crypto currency could indeed be the breakthrough we need but not in the
        way we imagined. The recent trend of crypto currency being an investment
        debacle and a hub of huge financial losses which made the headlines with
        its bearish trend on a long run, coupled with the banning of its
        operations by various countries, and the Ecological effect of crypto
        mining as brought its trade and reference as an high yield investment to
        a crippling fall. No doubt that this occurrence as shaped the mind of
        investors on the prospect of the project to generate massive wealth like
        it once did a while back. However, understanding the various
        complexities of the crypto market may take years to fulfill but would
        certainly be very productive upon successful understanding of its
        principles and future possibilities. Crypto currency is very much still
        a sustaining means of generating passive income, but not the way it was
        once viewed. In recent times there have been the indoctrination of
        various trading pairs mixed with crypto assets, specifically the
        Bitcion, some of this trading pairs where imported from forex and the
        Bitcoin has been mixed with trading currencies like the Euro or USD and
        as the potential to generate massive income, but then there is still
        something better, the introduction of an Eco friendly and guaranteed
        means of legal business, the Introduction of NFT’s. Non-Fungible Token
        seems to be the new life line of the Crypto verse; however little is
        known concerning this new aspect of Crypto Currency.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">What are Non Fungible Tokens (NFT’s)?</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        If you a crypto enthusiast or surfing the World Wide Web searching for
        crypto related topics and subjects, then definitely you would have come
        across NFTs. Following the crackdown on Crypto Trading by various
        nations of world for its volatile nature, Ecological side effects of
        crypto mining amongst other reasons, an idea to create something much
        more acceptable was put forth and as since then been a trending topic.
        Non Fungible Tokens are the future of Crypto currency, becoming a trade
        hub of authentic products and antiquities for crypto assets. Imagine
        this, an authentic image of Mozart, or Leonardo Di Vinci’s book of code,
        or just a common artist with an exquisite painting that depicts
        professional artistry, all this and more are what is being sold or
        auctioned in NFT’s. So basically you own something worth some few crypto
        assets, then you mint it for sale on the NFT platform, biddings are set
        and at the end of it all the highest bidder wins.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        You would agree with me that this is very simple and much more straight
        forward, but what is more is that it provides buyers to purchase
        authentic antiquities and art works, and also eradicates the stress of
        boundaries, as this would give artists in particular the opportunity to
        make sales of professional work of art across borders.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Prospect of Generating Passive Income</h2>

      <p class="post-text">
        When it comes to the prospect to generate massive income, NFT’s are
        quite on top of that. Imagine minting out an image with no background
        that changes into cities around the world, then it is minted and put up
        for sale on the NFT platform for Four Hundred Ethereum worth (400 eth),
        if sold then more than 1 million dollars would be ringing the alarm bell
        in an artist Crypto Wallet. Even more amateur artist or photographers
        who are lucky enough to paint, or get a very lovely shot of an event or
        natural scenery can get this items sold in NFT’s, remember art is
        subjective and you might just be lucky to be the next big thing.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">
        NFT’s might not seem like much right now, however there are various
        testimonies concerning its operations you can benefit from just by
        paying closer attention to it.
      </p>
